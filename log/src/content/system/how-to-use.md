## How This Website Works

This website is a digital garden, not a blog.

### What that means:

Ideas grow over time. A "budding" note might become "evergreen" as I refine it. Notes link to each other. Concepts build on concepts. There's no chronological pressure. I publish when ideas are ready, not on a schedule.

### The structure:

Free Notes contain essays, observations, and frameworks organized by theme. Project Logs document things I'm building (coming soon). Collections group related ideas thematically—Hacker Theology explores programming as craft and meaning, Meta Cognition examines how we think about thinking, Signal & Sense addresses information discovery in the age of algorithmic curation, Social Replacement Theory asks what we lose when technology replaces community, and Culture observes power, trust, and systems.


### Why I built it this way:

The site is deliberately minimal. Most blogs optimize for recency over relevance, hot takes over developed thought. I wanted a space where ideas could mature publicly, where half-formed thoughts could coexist with refined arguments, and where the structure itself reflected how thinking actually works: networked, iterative, and evolving.

If something here resonates, reach out. If it doesn't, that's fine too. Not everything is for everyone.
