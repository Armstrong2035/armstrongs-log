Advanced societies are characterized by a reduction in randomness. Rules function as tentacles that hold the social fabric together, or as maps that allow any individual—regardless of their status or history—to navigate the landscape. When rules are documented and standardized, they create a **High-Trust** environment. When they are unspoken, they create a playground for exploitation.

### The Game with Hidden Rules

During a 44-hour journey from Kigali to Nakuru, I found myself playing a game where the rules existed but were invisible to me. In a marketplace where prices are not displayed, or a bus station where fares are not listed, the "price" is not a fixed variable. It is a negotiation based on the perceived desperation and "outsiderness" of the participant.



This is the "Ignorance Tax." In a society where standards are vague, the local participants possess "compressed understanding" of the social lore. They know the baseline. The outsider, lacking this, is at the mercy of the power-holder.

### Chaos as a Business Model

It is tempting to view a lack of standardization as mere incompetence or a "developing" phase of a nation. However, there is often a deliberate dimension to this chaos.

When standards are undocumented, those in power (whether a border official or a bus driver) can impose their own rules in real-time. Transparency is a threat to those who profit from the "Darkness."
* **Order** creates accountability.
* **Chaos** creates leverage.

If a marketplace woman can look at a traveler and decide to double the price, she is participating in a micro-system that resists standardization because transparency would destroy her profit margin. Evil, in this context, is not just a moral failing; it is a rational response to an environment that rewards the concealment of information.

### The Erosion of Reciprocity

The most damaging consequence of this lack of legibility is the destruction of trust. When you are constantly scanning for a scam, you eventually lose the ability to recognize a fair deal. 

I found myself haggling unnecessarily with honest hawkers simply because the environment had forced me into a state of defensive paranoia. This is how **Low-Trust societies** are formed:
1.  **Vague Standards** lead to predatory behavior.
2.  **Predatory Behavior** leads to a "Scam Baseline" for all interactions.
3.  **The Scam Baseline** forces even honest participants to act defensively or aggressively.



### The Institutional First Domino

This mirrors the "Asymmetric Cycle." The traveler cannot break the cycle by being "good" (paying whatever is asked) because that only reinforces the predatory incentive. The change must come from the structural baseline: the documentation of rules, the pinning of price lists, and the move from **Contextual Power** to **Standardized Logic**.

Until a society decides to make its maps legible to the stranger, it will remain a collection of micro-fiefdoms where the "lore" of the local is the only protection against the whims of the powerful.
