Chess is a beautiful game. The more I learn about its theory, the more I connect its mental model to life. Within Chess there are many analogies for life, mental models that reduce the guess work in micro / macro living. This is a continuosly updated document about those lessons. 

### 1. The Principle of Control: 

A chess board has 64 squares. And your ability to win a game of chess correlates with how well you control the critical squares. Take the F pawns for example. They are considered a problem area, because if the squares they occupy are not properly defended, the opposition can combine their bishop and queen to create an early checkmate. This is possible because in the early stages of the game, those squares are defended only by the king. And the combination of the bishop, and queen overwhelms him. 

This is part of a foundational principle in chess. A square you attack with one piece is not truly yours. A square you attack with two pieces is safe. But a square you attack with three pieces, you control. And if you control a square with three pieces, and your opponent with two, you will win that exchange. 

This principle is also in football (or soccer as Americans call it). For teams that love to play a possesion game, numerical superiority is everything. In the build-up phase, they will let a midfielder play as close to the defenders as possible, this way if the opposition commits three men to winning the ball, they have four people to pass it around.

In the midfield, numerical superiority can win, or lose a game. Two men in the midfield will find it difficult to win against three men. Coaches like Pep Guardiola find ways to ensure they always win the midfield battle by using an inverted fullback, which is a defender that functions as an extra midfielder to ensure that battle is won. And in the final third, numerical superiority is everything. Teams will often try to load the opposition's box with numbers. Apart from three forwards, many teams use **overlapping fullbacks**, i.e a fullback that joins the attack, which means the opposition has to defend against five men. The foil to this plan, ofcourse is for the opposition to overload their own defence with five defenders, and use midfielders to cover the half spaces that are often created when the attacking team uses **touchline wingers**. The tactical game being played here is simple. Ensure that the other team don't have more men than you in any part of the pitch. Coaches come up with their own unique solutions around this principle. I don't watch other team based sports, but I assume that this principle is present. 

How does this map to real life? 

The more artifacts you are willing to commit to a pursuit, the higher your chances of winning at it. Be it family, business, religion, or even sin. The more time, money, and attention a person gives a thing, the more it thrives. We can invert this principle and say that it is easy to infer a person's priorities by looking at where they expend most of their resources. 

The tricky part is, an individual can be mistaken about what they prioritize. They may call themselves a family man, then realize that they dedicate few resources to their family. They may claim certain values, but fail at the moment of truth when executing that value system becomes too costly for them. You can tell where your heart truly is, by looking at where you spend your pieces. Whatever you focus on, wins. For good or for evil.
