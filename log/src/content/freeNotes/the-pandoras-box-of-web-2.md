Few technologies in history have caused as much of a paradigm shift as the internet. This shift is based upon a simple pipeline: collect information, organize information, and deliver information. Everything we have built on the internet exists somewhere within that pipeline. 

However, one of the unique and troubling attributes of digital technology is that it does not scale the way other technologies do. Mass adoption typically leads to a surge of new players in a space, but in fields like automobiles or cinema, the quality of the overall output does not necessarily drop. This is because the entry costs for playing in those fields remain high. The high barrier acts as a filter. 

With the internet, the inverse is the case. Mass adoption brought volume, but quality lags behind that volume. Because it is easy to get in the game, the output is quickly diluted. To understand how we arrived at this broken state, we must look at the evolution of the pipeline.

### The High-Agency Filter: ARPANET and Web 1.0

Born in 1962, ARPANET was a network of computers across a few well-funded universities. It was a convenient way for academics to share research. Its pipeline was narrow and elite:

* **Input:** Specialized academic papers by experts.
* **Organization:** A centrally maintained file of names and addresses.
* **Output:** High-signal research for a peer-reviewed community.

ARPANET was a small network coordinated by competent non-profit organizations with no incentives beyond academic excellence. Even when Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989 to scale this to global academia, the barrier to entry remained high. To participate in Web 1.0, you either needed a significant corporate budget or the "nerd grit" to learn HTML.



This technical and financial hurdle functioned as a filter for high-agency people. If you had something to contribute, you had to invest time or money to do so. The information was well-curved because the cost of "talking" was significant.

### The Democratization Paradox: Web 2.0

Post-2003, the game changed. Platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube democratized expression. They removed the need to learn HTML or own a server. All you needed was an email address and an opinion. 

This was the opening of Pandora’s Box. As user thirst for content increased, companies realized they could serve an unlimited stream of information, debates, and entertainment. They created a loop where posting became an avenue to make friends, share ideas, and eventually, make money. The Creator Economy was born.

But there is a profound epistemological problem with the Creator Economy: **if a person's livelihood depends on the volume of content they produce, they will keep talking even when they have nothing important to say.**

### From Signal to Noise

Once the internet became incredibly accessible and people could monetize the act of posting, it became a race to the bottom. Culturally, this paradigm is catastrophic. If you incentivize people to talk regardless of utility, you will have a few people saying useful things buried under a mountain of people saying useless things. 



The internet is now chock-full of data, more has been created in the last two years than in all of human history combined, yet the incentive to be "active" rather than "thoughtful" has led to a scenario where noise has drowned out the signal. We have achieved the fundamental value proposition of the internet (universal access) only to break the discovery engine that makes that access valuable.

The result is a new kind of gatekeeping. It is no longer a gatekeeping of *access*, but a gatekeeping of *attention*. As we moved from human curation to algorithmic curation to handle this volume, we didn't solve the problem; we just coded our biases into a system that is now losing its magic.
